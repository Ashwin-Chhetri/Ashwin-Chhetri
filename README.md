### Hi there 👋

I'm **Ashwin Chhetri**, a software engineer working at  
**Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE)**, Eastern Himalaya – Northeast India Office.  

🌱 I work at the intersection of **software engineering, biodiversity informatics, and ecological data management**, building tools that help researchers and conservationists make sense of complex data.  

I believe every challenge is an opportunity to learn, and every solution is a stepping stone towards meaningful impact.

---

### 🔭 Current Work
- Designing **biodiversity monitoring apps** for long-term ecological data collection (protocol-driven, field-ready).
- Building **multi-tenancy Laravel + Vue applications** for project-level data management.
- Developing **species distribution modeling portals** (MaxEnt / ensemble models) to support forest restoration in the Himalayas.
- Creating **asset management systems** for research and field operations.
- Exploring **citizen science workflows** with platforms like iNaturalist, mWater, and GBIF.

---

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** (with a focus on ecological data applications).
- **Cloud-native architectures** for scalable environmental data systems.
- **Advanced geospatial tools** for conservation.

---

### 💬 Ask me about
- **Databases & Data Pipelines** (SQLite, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, multi-tenancy strategies).
- **Biodiversity Informatics** (species monitoring, ecological modeling, citizen science).
- **Cloud & DevOps** (AWS certified, Docker, CI/CD, scalable APIs).
- **Cross-platform apps** with **Flutter** and **Vue.js**.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I play piano and love traveling to mountains 🌄 — both feed into my coding creativity.
